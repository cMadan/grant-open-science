# Mozilla Open Science mini-grant

## Idea

Organize a workshop for:
* New PIs
* Future PIs (people who want to be PIs and who we want in academia)
* Established PIs who want to help the above
* From biomedical, machine learning, and other communities
* Especially for people who have (had) less opportunities in their career

## Goals
* Learn how other communities do inclusive and open science
* Learn about tools like Github
* Learn about leadership and mentoring 
* Meet awesome tweeps
* Change academia (especially machine learning / biomedical) :D 

## When & where

In the Netherlands, perhaps at http://www.lorentzcenter.nl/Lorentz-eScience.php. End of 2019 / start of 2020. Or summer 2020.
